"Unicode 15.0 adds 4,489 characters, for a total of 149,186 characters. These additions include 2 new scripts, for a total of 161 scripts, along with 20 new emoji characters, and 4,193 CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) ideographs."--unicode.org (V.15.0.0)


As we become more connected, as geographical and cultural boundries blurre away, we inquire more chrachters to particepate in our communication, creations and media. Chrachters we use today are numirus. Unicode standrizes the meaning and the uses of such a dinse forest of orthographs. 
To find a chrachter among such density
would be an extra hard task, but imagin the complexity if we count in the relationships and meanings these chracters form. Finding a comperhinsable string of chrachters can reach impossibilty in some cases.

regular expression (regex) are essintial in simplfying such task. If you want to fing the lyrics of the sigment of chrachters <"na Mah"> in the the lyrics of the (Mana Mana) song in a collection of all modern US lyrics, regex is the set of keys that correspond to our goal. 

in this tutorial, I will focus on degets as a regex concept.

## Summary
Digit (0-9). In different combnations and with the additions of especial chrachters, we create strings of numbers to convay information. like how the compnation of "(tree)three-four" as a stnring hints to a phone number. with the addition of especial chrachters like ("-|.| |+|+1|") we imphsise the information, and exband the perception of what the digits meant and what they are used for.
in the below example example a table of phone numbers, written as a regular expressions, and digits which will use through out this tutorial. 


<!-- Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary. -->
